Parsing FEN strings determines ordering of piece lists in Position. Consequently it determines move generation order. 
So probably this will cause engine to play color-flipped position much weaker/ stronger.
Should either do some nice move ordering or at least shuffle generated moves at random?

Thinking about attack LUT and promotions. At first I thought that I should consider promotions in attack LUT 
(e.g pawn should square on the other side  the board be flagged as 'attacked by pawn on promotion rank'). But then I realized
that the table is indexed by square difference, not by actual squares. So one entry in the table can originate from arbitrary rank-
not necessarily from the promoting rank.
Looks like promoting and then looking up is the way to go. Also.. pretty natural in typical movegen algorithm (generate pseudolegal and then filter out illegal)

Done with perft test suite. Machess completes the suite in ~46.6 seconds; magog completes the same test in ~27.0 s! Great!

22.03.2024
Done with iterative perft. The implementation is on the "iterativePerft" branch. 
Perftsuite (recursive) done in ~27.4 s. Iterative version completed in ~27-29s. 
Disappointing result - was expecting some speedup after reading https://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=53408

26.03.2024
Done with basic static position evaluation. Includes material and mobility. I've decided to copy-paste-modify original move generation code rather
than make the old one more general. This way I can skip the need for slice with moves completely. As a bonus I discovered that I can skip 
some superfluous legality tests:
-now I have one legality test for all 4 promotions
-no need to do legality test after castling
Another minor optimization: appending four promotions at once

28.03.2024
Movegen with checking for doublechecks: ~23,2s

05.04.2024
Movegen with specialized movegen in leaf nodes (doublechecks, captures, interpo)

23.04.2024
Couldn't get movegen any faster really. Version with pin checking is way slower. Would like to investigate later. All the intermediate work is left at 
specialized_movegen branch.

Testing search and evaluate/score functions. Found an interesting bug while calculating mobility score. When calculating mobility of enemy pieces (the ones that are not moving).
The piece tries to take its own pawn because the enPassant square is set. So simply making a null-move does not guarrantee calculating correct mobility of enemy pieces. Luckily
this caused panic and rather than falfifying mobility score. So clean crash rather than elusive bug. Probably Machess engine has the same bug that went undetected!

About iterative deepening under time control.
Just finished one of the first games against engine. I added a timeout condition in the search loop. This way engine does not spend too much time searching exhaustively at 
depth reached (which makes it loose on time).
However we cannot simply break out from the search loop in arbitrary moment because this will cause engine to miss obvious moves. Specifically we must not quit right after descending
on depth deeper. Here a relevant log from Arena with my comments added:

Got it working but still got the following situation where it hangs the queen. But this blunder can be attributed to lack of quiescence search 
(obviously it thinks it captured a piece at the end of the line). Log below:

Completed quiescence search. Dode a 10 round tournament against Machess (5 openings as both black and white). Results are kind of disappointing :).
It lost all 10 out of 10 rounds! :)
Looks like it is simply slower. In scandinavian defense machess took 6 seconds to find the e4e5. 
Magog took 6s for the same move.
Time to investigate - probably it is due to bad move ordering machess searches captures first 
(and also has separate piece list per piece type)
but it could also be a problem with small NPS.. (simply slow raw movegen and evaluation function)

22.05.2024
Yup the engine has 200k less nps than Machess (~500k vs ~300k). Did some profiling with go pprof and found out that 
isUnderCheckMethod appears quite high on the list.
To be more specific switch in that method is quite hot.

Here's a pprof list (note that it's not exactly from the commited version - this is a color-blind of the switch cases - see lines: 296, 297, 302.. anyway the results are on par)

    (pprof) list isUnderCheck
    Total: 28.55s

        300ms      300ms    294:   for _, attackFrom := range enemyPieces {
        60ms      260ms    295:           moveIdx = moveIndex(attackFrom, destSquare)
        1.17s      1.17s    296:           switch pos.board[attackFrom]&ColorlessPiece {       
            .          .    297:           case Knight:
        170ms      170ms    298:                   if attackTable[moveIdx]&KnightAttacks == 0 {
            .          .    299:                           continue
            .          .    300:                   }
            .          .    301:                   return true

So I thought that maybe the switch in Golang is kindof slow (a premonition I have ever since I 
debugged a switch statement in Golang - for some reason you never jump directly to the desired case, you have to step over few times. This never happened in Java).
Following that lead I've made a version that uses a LUT with isCheckedByXX function containing
functions for each piece. This worked much slower (~200k nps). 
Here's the relevant listing:

Search on depth 7 never finishes! Wait. It was for search from start pos. perft(7, startpos) has 3*10^9 nodes. So maybe not a bug.

Anyway started new search before leaving house. 
perft(7,startpos can get to 3,1*10^9 nodes) so let's see if my search gets there.

25.05.2024 - 2 Came back after 2 hours and perft (7, startpos) still didn't finish (~800mln nodes after 2 hours). What's worse is I've noticed a slow
but steady degradation in nps. When I came back it dropped down to ~131k. Very strange.
Previous run didn' have the same problem! After the same period of time it maintained the tempo.
I thought that maybe it's int overflow but no. Didn't happen. It's a slow gradual slowdown.
Have a log so maybe I can plot it. Or I can profile it at different time points (how?)

25.05.2024 - 3 ok it's speeding back up as I type! It must have been a problem with laptop 
energy saving mode. I guess I need to display nps based on speed since the last nps log rather than
cumulative nps.

25.05.2024 - 4 ok. it stopped after 6 hours of searching... 

    info nodes 4406000000 time 21573542 nps 204231

The counter didn't overflow - why?
OK. nodes number is higher because of quiescence search.. so that makes sense.

I've tried to compare prof recordings after my change. I've run go tool as webserver (easiest way to display flamegraphs).
And then I've run into another surprise. I couldn't reliably compare the data - at least the per source line list command.
Old profiles show invalid data interposed on new sources. Basically I was seeing old profile recordings that listed methods that didn't exist at the time.
I've tried to delete the *.exe file but the pprof still run successfully and still has shown the same garbage. I guess I need to recompile exe before running pprof or sth..

27.05.2024
Changed mogeven to generate pawn takes first.
Did test on startpos and search for depth=5 could barely notice any difference in number of nodes evaluated (better
ordering should need fewer nodes evaluation due to some branches being pruned). 
Here are 4 consecutives runs for each implementation:
 
        pawn moves mixed
    5476069
    5499487
    5491873
    5486023
        pawn takes first
    5471470
    5494910
    5497865
    5492182

However when I did search depth=4 from kiwipete position  the story is different
    pawn takes first
    104 763 297	nodes evaluated; (nps: 289365; time: 361134)
    pawn moves mixed 
    info nodes 1741500000 time 5665091 nps 307408 (and counting...)

EDIT 02.06.2024 - here are "go depth 4" results  after capture ordering (magog.0.6)
    info nodes 13000000 time 66124 nps 196599
    info nodes 13500000 time 68544 nps 196951

    bestmove e2a6

I had to break  the depth=4 (actually kill the program - there's no break flag in
 quiescence function so stop command wouldn't work). Here are results for depth=3

pawn takes mixed:
    info pv e2a6 e6d5 c3d5 e7e5 score cp 50 depth 3 nodes 134_495_127 time 462728 nps 290656

machess for reference:

    bestmove e2a6

Note that not only the speed but also the ordering is better here than in Machess!


28.05.2024
Did a rematch. Getting pwnd by machess. Somethings bad with move ordering in timebased play..
Not sure what.
In this situation magog is very likely to miss a mate in 1.

If I let it do search to full depth it does not miss it and plays d8f6. However with the bad timing
(quite likely as it turns out) it plays g8f6 and never reaching reply Qh5f7.
__For some reason it does not happen in machess. I need to add extra logging to it and investigate.
Otherwise this blunder looks like could be rectified with killer moves heuristic...
Or trivial fix would be to never stop searching on odd depths (i.e engine's own moves)

Ok. So the root cause of blunder was the same as was in Machess some years ago. I mistakenly believed that
results from interrupted alphaBeta search at some depth can be any good. No they are not. 
In general they're can contain horrible blunder (hanging pieces, mates in 1). If engine had alpha beta interrupted then it should just return 
search results from previous iteration of ItDeep (even though some sourcess suggest otherwise).

Magog had a bug in parsing moves list in uci position command. It failed to recognize that double pushes make pawns vulnerable 
to en-passant attacks. Luckily it was rather easy to find because it made the engine to make illegal moves (tried to capture 
with a pawn that wasn't there). So 2 games were lost due to illegal games but 
it made at least one other occasion where it made a blunder in equal position by not taking E-P. Bug fixed.

Results are only slightly better:

2: Magog.0.5            3,5/10 =000100=1= ··········   22,75

Here it strongly prefers to trade bishop for 2 pawns. Very strange as machess with the same evaluation function retreats bishop to b4d6 after finishing depth 3. 
However it does play it after full search depth =4 so it's also an ordering/speed issue.

Had great success with magog.0.6 where moves are sorted by capture score. Here are results:
        Engine               Score          Ma         Ma    S-B
    1: Machess-1.0-SNAPSHOT 5,5/10 ииииииииии =1=10=1=0=   24,75
    2: Magog.0.6            4,5/10 =0=01=0=1= ииииииииии   24,75

However the big question is. Why it's still worse than Machess? My guess is that it's caused by worse move ordering (raw speed is already better).
And ordering may be worse for two reasons:
1. machess has separate piece lists for every type.
2. It uses copyMakeMove rather than Make/Unmake move. (pieces are shuffled at MoveUnmake)

So I made a version with separate piece list for knights (so pawns, knights and sliding pieces). And this version turned out to be worse
than magog.0.6. Here are arena results:
    Engine               Score          Ma         Ma         Ma    S-B
    1: Machess-1.0-SNAPSHOT 11,0/20 ииииииииии =1=10=1=0= =1=101100=  104,50
    2: Magog.0.6            10,0/20 =0=01=0=1= ииииииииии 10======1=   99,00
    3: Magog.0.7            9,0/20  =0=010011= 01======0= ииииииииии   94,50
It seems that this version is worse because while it has modest ordering improvement for positions with many captures (kiwipete),
it suffers from small decrease in raw speed.
Next to try is the version with copyMakeMove (now I remember that make/unkame version fo Machess was a failure too)

03.06.2024
Finished the copyMakeMove version. It's 3x slower. Profiler shows that there is a lot of heap allocations and gc going on. 
Looks like it is related with conversion between values and pointers for method calls. Need to investigate more:
-need to investigate isLegal() version with working on positionStack rather that autoconversions on method calls that golang provides.
