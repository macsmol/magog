promising (2.0?):
-0x88 board with padding for faster sliders movegen: https://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=62279&sid=c7b5a5b1b3297382937208ab995ba79d
-better time management (large fraction of preallocated time wasted in opening and midgame due to large branching factor in iterative deepening)

rathole:
-faster/specialized (when in check, in doublecheck, pinned) movegen
